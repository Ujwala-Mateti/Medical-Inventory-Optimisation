# Medical-Inventory-Optimisation
## Overview
This project was completed as part of my internship, where I focused on designing and implementing solutions to optimize the inventory system for a medical facility.
Using SQL, I analyzed stock levels, usage patterns, and order history to provide actionable recommendations that reduce wastage, prevent stockouts, and improve overall efficiency in inventory management.
By applying my data skills and SQL expertise to healthcare operations, I learned how data-driven insights can enhance efficiency in a real-world organizational setting.

## Project Description
The main objective was to optimize inventory levels of medical supplies and equipment by:
* Analyzing consumption and replenishment rates using SQL
* Identifying slow-moving and critical items
* Automating stock tracking and alerts for shortages/excesses
* Providing actionable recommendations based on data analysis

## Techniques & Approach
* Data extraction and manipulation using SQL queries
* Analysis of demand patterns and consumption rates
* Identification of slow-moving and fast-moving items
* Performance tracking of suppliers based on delivery timelines

## Tools
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Environment: pgAdmin
* Other tools: draw.io(Visualisation), Microsoft Excel

## Results
Identified 13% bounce rate and drugs with a high return rate, helping to optimize procurement.
Determined understocked drugs that needed stock maximization to prevent stockouts.
